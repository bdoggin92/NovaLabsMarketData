AutoPilot brings conversational AI, market data, execution tools and automation into one local terminal. It supports prediction markets, spot and perpetual crypto, Solana and EVM DeFi, arbitrage research, portfolio tracking, token launches and Bittensor workflows.

The application can connect to real accounts, execute commands and submit transactions. Recommended to start by using the dry-run mode to fully understand and familiarise yourself with the bot.

## Start here

Requirements: **Node.js 22+**. Some exchange and mining integrations also require Python 3.

```bash
npm install -g https://github.com/recogardtech/AutoPilotPM/releases/latest/download/autopilot.tgz --loglevel=error
autopilot onboard
autopilot start
```

Open Dashboard at <http://127.0.0.1:18789/webchat>.

### Build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/recogardtech/AutoPilotPM.git
cd AutoPilotPM
npm install
cp .env.example .env
npm run build
npm start
```

### Docker

```bash
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up --build
```

The provided Compose configuration publishes the dashboard only on `127.0.0.1:18789`.

### Market coverage

- **Prediction markets:** live execution and research across CLOB, regulated, sports and forecasting platforms.
- **Perpetual futures:** long/short positions, leverage, TP/SL, funding and liquidation monitoring. Maximum leverage depends on the venue and can reach 200x.
- **Solana:** Jupiter, Raydium, Orca, Meteora, Kamino, MarginFi, Solend, Pump.fun and Bags.fm, with Jito support.
- **EVM:** Uniswap V3, 1inch, PancakeSwap, Virtuals, Clanker and Veil on Ethereum, Base, Arbitrum, Optimism and Polygon.
- **Cross-chain and payments:** Wormhole transfers and x402 USDC payments.

### Intelligence and automation

AutoPilot combines four main agent roles-general, trading, research and alerts-with providers such as Claude, OpenAI, Gemini, Groq, Together, Fireworks, Bedrock and Ollama. Memory uses persistent facts, user profiles, semantic retrieval and compacted conversation history.

Trading workflows include:

- mean reversion, momentum, market making and DCA;
- internal, cross-platform and combinatorial arbitrage;
- whale monitoring and controlled copy trading;
- smart routing, backtesting and P&L analysis;
- a decision ledger with confidence calibration and optional on-chain anchoring;
- GoPlus token checks, scam-address screening and pre-trade validation.

## Dashboard / WebChat

The browser client provides project folders, conversation search, artifacts, extracted code, paginated history and automatic context compaction. Sessions are stored locally and survive restarts.
